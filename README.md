# mf_grc_synapse

Author: Eugenio Piasini, UCL

This repository contains some code used to match models of the cerebellar mossy fibre to granule cell synaptic mechanisms to experimental data (provided by Jason Rothman). The models obtained were published in [1] and are available in NeuorML format on the Open Source Brain [2]. This code is only conserved here for future reference; see [1] for a detailed description of the models and the methods used to derive them.
